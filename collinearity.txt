mlr<-lm(MPG~., data = Cars)
summary(mlr)
regclass::VIF(mlr)
vif(mlr)

MASS::stepAIC(mlr,direction="backward")

pred
mlr$residuals




where VIF is in package regclass ..VIF variance inflation factor tell us which columns are not helping the data or not significant.
If the result is over 20 of any column then we need to eliminate columns causing collinearity
We can do this by using  stepAIC which is in MASS packagae.
Use direction "both" to get the correct subset to calculate the regression. 
we can do prediction unless we find the regression...R value ..multi R for multiple variables.
Once we have the best subset then see whether the Y value we have for the data set is matching the Y valu e( IN this case MPG) .
for that use residuals function ..
Then conduct analysis

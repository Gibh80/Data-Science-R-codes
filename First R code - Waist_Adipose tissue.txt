Find AT of a person with waist size 30, 85, 140 
First you should ensure that the waist is between the min and max range in data set.
If it is outisde this range then the Y value is not correct.

Y^ = B0+B1*x 
R2 = more than 0.95 and less than 1 is really good
less than 0.75 is not good
less than 0.85 is moderate 
mostly in healthcare they dont consider less than 0.95
